# Stack Underflow

## Requirements

This program requires **pygame** and the default spyder installation.
``` cmd
pip install pygame
```

## Running

This can be done via command prompt:

```cmd
cd <folder directory>\src
python main.py
```

or double clicking the file in file explorer on windows.

### Inside Spyder

Navigate to the `main.py` file and run.
