... ... ... ... ... CONGRATULATIONS!!! You did it! You survived your first shift!!! 

Your conveyor belt placing skills were quite excellent, you only wasted $46,964,000 USD in belts and "creatively disposed of" $780,987,390 USD of supplies.

That's below the company record (set by the last intern)!

A few things to note about your shift today: 

You forgot to wear your hard-hat.

Your co-workers took bets on whether you would quit by level 3.

We will deduct conveyor and lost inventory costs from your paycheck (remember you're an unpaid intern).

That's good, you'll be working here forever.

Now, go home, get some rest, and prepare for Day 2! You will have 255 levels to complete.

Thank you for playing our game!!! Press ENTER to clock out #1 intern!!!
