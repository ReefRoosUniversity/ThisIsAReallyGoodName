... ... ... ... ... CONGRATULATIONS!!! You did it! You survived your first shift at ... whatever this factory does.

Your conveyor belt placing skills were, ... good enough ... you only wasted $46,964,000 USD in belts!
That's below the company record (set by the last intern who accidentally made a Mobius strip).

A few things to note from your shift today:

You successfully delivered ... ... ... enough supplies to not get fired.

You also "creatively disposed of" $780,987,390 USD of supplies. HR will be in touch.

The foreman said something about "concerning structural decisions".

Your co-workers took bets on whether you would rage-quit by level 3.

We might have to deduct conveyor and lost inventory costs from your paycheck (remember you're an unpaid intern),
That's good! You'll be working here forever.

Now, go home, get some rest, and prepare for Day 2! You will have 255 levels to complete.
